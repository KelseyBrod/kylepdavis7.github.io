<!-- Great job creating a website with a flow! I liked that you linked to a google drive explanation at the end. I wondered how that explanation could enter into the site moreâ€”what is the connection between simplicity and these binaries that you set up? How can more of Honduras enter into the site? Can the aesthetic of the plastic water bottle be emphasized i.e. try and create an experience like drinking from a water bag? All fun questions and not necessarily the right direction for you. -->
